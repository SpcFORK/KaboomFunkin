# KaboomFunkin

## Introduction

Welcome to KaboomFunkin'! This is a clone of the popular rhythm game built using the Kaboom.js game programming library.

With support for modding, and server requests for mod loading.
The KFXML API allows mod creators to not only distribute their mods and charts to dynamically load mod
data rather than installing a mod file.

*** and that's only ONE feature ***

KaboomFunk also allows for injecting JS into the global-scope and create weeks.
